Max is a program written by Alexander Ferrin (begun June 2021) that can be easily interacted with.
He is capable of running simple calculations, chatting with the user,
playing several games, converting values, etc.

The following files are imports and are not intended to be run on their own:
words.py
MaxIntro.py

It is always recommended that you run the most recent version of Max, as
previous versions will likely be outdated.

Please do not, under any circumstance, try to pass max off as your own code.
I'd say it's copyright, but I don't have that kind of control. Just be smart.

Have fun!
